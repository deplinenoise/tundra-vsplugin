Visual Studio extension for Tundra 2.0
=============================================================================

Tundra is a high-performance code build system designed to give the best
possible incremental build times even for very large software projects.

This extension supports the "Compile current file" action in Visual Studio
projects generated by Tundra. Normally Visual Studio cannot build individual
source files in a NMake project as it doesn't run any commands itself.

It also provides convenience commands for building/re-building/cleaning the
solution using Tundra.

A prebuilt VSIX can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/katacode/tundra-vsplugin/raw/master/Bin/TundraExtsVs.vsix).
